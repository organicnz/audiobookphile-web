/**
 * Playability of a library item, derived from the media payload.
 *
 * The API exposes track information in three different shapes depending on
 * which endpoint served the payload, and historically each call site picked a
 * different one:
 *
 *   - detail endpoint  -> `audioFiles` (full array) and `numTracks`
 *   - shelf / list     -> neither (the projection omits the multi-megabyte
 *                        `audio_files` column) — only `numTracks`, read from
 *                        the trigger-maintained `num_tracks` counter
 *   - `tracks`         -> **never emitted by the API at all**; it only ever
 *                        existed in the web's own DB mapper. Reading it
 *                        therefore always yielded `undefined`, and every
 *                        `tracks.length > 0` guard silently evaluated false,
 *                        which is why Play was hidden for playable books and
 *                        why the detail page's cover overlay shipped a
 *                        Play button wired to an empty handler.
 *
 * Everything that needs to ask "can this play?" goes through
 * `getBookTrackCount` / `isLibraryItemPlayable` so that shape drift can never
 * reappear as a hidden button.
 */

/**
 * Number of audio tracks for a book, across all payload shapes.
 *
 * Order matters: the concrete array wins over the denormalised counter so a
 * stale `numTracks` can never mask a populated `audioFiles`. `duration` is
 * used only as a last-resort signal -- a book with a known runtime was
 * scanned from real media, so it is playable even if its track array was
 * dropped by an older writer that predates the `num_tracks` column.
