# Audiobookphile 🎧

A serverless, open-source audiobook and podcast client. Built with Next.js 16, Supabase, and deployed effortlessly on Vercel.

Audiobookphile is designed for users who want a beautiful, premium "Liquid Glass" UI for their audiobooks, without the hassle of managing servers or docker containers. It's an excellent, zero-maintenance alternative to traditional self-hosted solutions.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Auth & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (Liquid Glass Aesthetic)

## One-Click Deployment

1. **Set up Supabase**: Create a free project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
2. **Deploy to Vercel**: Click the "Deploy with Vercel" button above.
3. **Configure Environment**: Provide your Supabase project URL and API keys during the Vercel deployment.
4. **Push Database Schema**: See the [Database Setup](#database-setup) section below.

## Environment Variables

The canonical env source lives in the backend repo (`audiobookphile-backend/env/`). Generate your local env from it:

```bash
../audiobookphile-backend/scripts/sync-env.sh        # local
# or, for production-shaped values:
../audiobookphile-backend/scripts/sync-env.sh --prod
```

`.env.example` lists every variable with documentation for the open-source community. Secrets are never stored in these files — configure them in Vercel (web), Supabase Vault, or Edge Function secrets.

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Your Supabase project URL                                                                                    |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anon/public key                                                                                |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Server-side service role key (never expose to browser)                                                       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`          | Public URL of your app (required for OAuth redirects)                                                        |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`       | (Optional) PostHog analytics + feature flags (flags use `useFeatureFlag`, see `src/shared/lib/analytics.ts`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`      | (Optional) PostHog ingest host (default `https://us.i.posthog.com`)                                          |

Feature flags are read from PostHog. Existing flags: `passkey_2fa` (kill-switch for passkey/biometric 2FA — defaults ON, disable in PostHog to turn off without a deploy).

> `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must never be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and must never appear in client-side code.

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Setup & Migration

All schema changes are tracked as Supabase CLI migration files in `supabase/migrations/`.

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
bunx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Apply all migrations
bunx supabase db push
```

### Migrating from Audiobookshelf (SQLite)

If you are coming from a traditional self-hosted Audiobookshelf instance and want to move your metadata to Audiobookphile's Postgres backend, we've included a migration toolkit! Check out the `supabase-migration-toolkit` skill/scripts to convert your SQLite schema and bulk-upload your data to Supabase.

## Hybrid Storage (Supabase + Backblaze B2)

The client supports a hybrid storage model to minimize cloud costs.

- **Small files (< 25MB):** Cover images, metadata files, and short podcast clips are securely uploaded directly to Supabase Storage.
- **Large files (>= 25MB):** Full audiobooks are securely uploaded directly to Backblaze B2 using S3 pre-signed URLs.

To enable this, provide the `B2_*` environment variables. The client and backend will seamlessly route uploads and playback between the two providers based on file size.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The repository comes pre-configured with two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Deploy Next.js Web App (`deploy-web.yml`)**: On pushes to `main` and PRs, runs the full verification pipeline (security audit, typecheck, lint, production build), then Lighthouse and bundle size-limit checks. On `main` pushes it deploys to Vercel via the Vercel CLI, runs a gated E2E smoke test against the preview deployment, and promotes it to production.
2. **CodeQL Security Scan (`codeql.yml`)**: Static security analysis on pushes, PRs, and a weekly schedule.

Ensure you configure your GitHub Repository Secrets (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`, `PLAYWRIGHT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `PLAYWRIGHT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `PLAYWRIGHT_MEMBER_EMAIL`, `PLAYWRIGHT_MEMBER_PASSWORD`) to enable production deploys and E2E verification.

## Docker (Local / Self-Hosted)

A Docker setup is available if you prefer to host it yourself instead of Vercel.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
